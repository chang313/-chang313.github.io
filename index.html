                    <p> : Developed video player for analyzing human EEG. The player takes a movie with some timestamps of 'emotional scenes', and gets user input in quadrant. 
                        I struggled with choosing proper language & framework. I first chose Python, but it took too much effort to make GUI by using libraries. So, I used PyQT later. 
                        During this intern, I've learned that using proper language or framework is critical for high productivity. </p>

                        I quit it for some personal reason, but I experienced Ardupilot software debugging with drone simulator to find some bugs in the paper.

                        We held seminar every week to study & share current technology each other. I presented about Flask in the seminar. We also hosted Hackerton in 2019 fall semester. </p>

                    <div id="hyper">
                        Front-end development of email client for heavy user
                        <a href="https://github.com/chang313/PoZangZee" id="link"> (https://github.com/chang313/PoZangZee)</a>

                    <p> : Our team decided to use React to develop email client for heavy user who frequently uses emails in their work. 
                        I took the part of developing 'text highlighting' function when writing email. 
                        This function makes you save frequently used format except the highlited part which can be changed later such as name, date, course, etc. 
                        So, heavy users who write lots of emails with same form can benefit from it. I first experienced web development in this course, and also used 
                        HTML, CSS, Javascript for the first time. I struggled with understanding other member's code with dirty comment and function name. 
                        From this experience, I realized that writing clear comment and intuitive function name also takes important part to work together. 
                        Moreover, I experienced how 'User centered design' process is working through this team project. We were required to make GUI 'not for us'. 
                        Needfinding, series of prototyping with different fidelities, and user testing are included in this design process. Some functions that we devised were 
                        excluded in final version because users didn't use it during user testing.
